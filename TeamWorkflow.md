# Team Workflow for getrandomtrip.com

This document outlines the collaborative workflow for the getrandomtrip.com team, ensuring a seamless and efficient process from product definition to deployment. Our goal is to maintain high-quality standards and fidelity to our brand vision, inspired by Black Tomato.

---

## 1. Sequence of Collaboration

The project follows a sequential workflow, with clear handoffs between roles. Each phase must be completed and validated before the next one begins.

1. **Product Manager**: Defines the product vision, roadmap, and user stories based on `UserFlow.md`.
2. **UX/UI Designer**: Translates user stories into wireframes, mockups, and a style guide.
3. **Frontend & Backend Developers**: Implement the user interface, business logic, and APIs.
4. **DevOps Assistant**: Manages infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and deployments.
5. **QA Tester**: Conducts testing throughout the development process to ensure quality and functionality.
6. **Copywriter Assistant**: Crafts and validates user-facing copy across UI, emails, and landing pages.

---

## 2. Validation Checkpoints

- **Product Definition**: The Product Manager validates user stories against `UserFlow.md` and **Guidelines.md**, confirming style alignment and brand consistency.
- **Design Validation**: UX/UI Designer conducts a formal review comparing wireframes and specs to `Guidelines.md`, followed by an alignment meeting with the Product Manager to ensure correct interpretation.
- **Development Validation**: Frontend & Backend Developers check their implementation against design specs, API contracts, and `Guidelines.md` before marking components as ready.
- **QA Validation**: QA Tester verifies the application against `UserFlow.md`, design specs, `Guidelines.md`, and acceptance criteria.
- **Copy Validation**: Copywriter Assistant confirms all copy aligns with tone, style, and brand voice rules as defined in `Guidelines.md`.

---

## 3. Deliverable Gating

- **Completion Signal**: Use `[DONE]` in a commit message, PR title, or issue. Include confirmation of `Guidelines.md` compliance (e.g., ‚Äú‚úì Design verified via Guidelines.md‚Äù).
- **Handoff Protocol**: Indicate deliverable name and next agent mention (e.g., `landing-page-design ‚úÖ done ‚Üí @FrontendDeveloper`). Use standardized commit messages or labels for readiness.

---

## 4. Communication Protocol

- **Alignment Meetings**: Schedule brief syncs at key handoffs:
  - After Product roadmap is finalized  
  - Before UX/UI design begins  
  - After UX/UI ‚Üí Frontend handoff  
  - Pre-release sprint demos  
- **Documentation**: Record meeting notes and action points in a shared channel or project board for clarity and auditability.

---

## 5. Fallback Loops

- **QA Finds a Bug**: QA Tester creates a bug report and assigns it to Frontend or Backend.
- **Developer Fixes the Bug**: Developer makes the fix and opens a pull request.
- **QA Re-tests**: QA Tester retests the feature and closes the report if resolved.
- **Design Feedback**: If a design issue arises, QA or Developer notifies the UX/UI Designer for revision.

---

## 6. Use of Shared Context

- All team members reference `Guidelines.md` for style, tone, naming, and animations.  
- **Component Library**: Maintain a shared style token file or components directory aligned with `Guidelines.md`. This library should be accessible to Frontend and Copywriter.

---

## üß† Learning & Feedback Loop

- Hold retrospectives every two sprints to assess:
  - Consistency in alignment
  - Handoff bottlenecks
  - Opportunities to refine style or process
- Document retrospective outcomes for future team onboarding and continuous improvement.
