# Randomtrip End-to-End Test Plan

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the end-to-end test plan for the Randomtrip web application, covering key user flows and functionalities.

## 2. Test Objectives
- Verify that the core user flow (from landing page to destination revelation) functions as expected.
- Ensure all UI components are rendered correctly and are interactive.
- Validate pricing logic and dynamic updates.
- Confirm successful payment simulation and post-purchase experience.
- Identify and report any bugs or deviations from the expected behavior.

## 3. Scope of Testing
- **User Flow:**
  - Landing Page interaction.
  - Exploration Initial (Top Trippers, By Traveller, Roadtrip, Trippers Decode).
  - Experience Level selection.
  - Basic Configuration.
  - Premium Filters selection.
  - Add-ons selection.
  - Summary and Payment (simulated).
  - Post-Purchase experience.
  - Destination Revelation.
- **Functionality:**
  - Button clicks and navigation.
  - Form submissions and data handling.
  - Dynamic price calculations.
  - Error handling (e.g., payment failure, map loading issues).
- **UI/UX:**
  - Responsiveness across different screen sizes (desktop, mobile).
  - Adherence to design guidelines (colors, typography, spacing).

## 4. Test Environment
- **Browser:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest stable versions).
- **Devices:** Desktop, Tablet, Mobile (iOS, Android).
- **Backend:** Staging environment with mock API data.

## 5. Test Cases (High-Level)

### 5.1. Happy Path
- User navigates through the entire flow, selecting options and completing a simulated purchase.

### 5.2. Edge Cases & Error Handling
- **Payment Failure:** Simulate a failed payment and verify error message and retry option.
- **Map Loading Failure:** Simulate map not loading on destination revelation and verify fallback.
- **No Filters/Add-ons:** Verify flow continues with base price if no premium options are selected.
- **Solo Traveller Markup:** Verify 50% markup is applied correctly.

### 5.3. Cross-Browser/Device Compatibility
- Verify UI and functionality across all specified browsers and devices.
